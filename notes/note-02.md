## GitHub

Let's create a fork of the offical class Git repository.

1. Accept the invitation to the `lc-cs-373` organization (check your email to
   find the invitation).
2. Click on the `fall-2024` repository (not any of the repository that have a
   suffix after `fall-2024`)
3. Click on the `Fork` button
   1. Change `Owner` to `lc-cs-373`
   2. Add a suffix to the original repository name to make unique within the
      organization (e.g., add a dash followed by your initials); that is now
      *your* repository
   3. Click on `Create fork`
